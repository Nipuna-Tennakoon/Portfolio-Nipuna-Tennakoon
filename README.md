1. **Machine Learning Projects**
   
   - **Song Lyrics Classification**

      The goal of this project is to classify song lyrics into their respective genres using machine learning techniques. By leveraging distributed machine learning with MLlib and Apache Spark, the model is able to process large amounts of text data efficiently. This classification model applies various text preprocessing methods like Tokenizer, Word2Vec, and CountVectorizer to transform lyrics into usable features, and then utilizes machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to categorize the lyrics into genres.

   - **Hybrid Classifier for Notification Classification**

     This project classifies system notifications using a hybrid approach with regular expressions, Logistic Regression, and an LLM in GroqCloud. It was further developed and deployed on a local server using FastAPI to serve predictions.
