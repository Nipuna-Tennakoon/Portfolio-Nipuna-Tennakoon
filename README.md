1. **Machine Learning Projects**
   
   - **Song Lyrics Classification**

      The goal of this project is to classify song lyrics into their respective genres using machine-learning techniques. By leveraging distributed machine learning with MLlib and Apache Spark, the model is able to process large amounts of text data efficiently. This classification model applies transformers of Tokenizer, Word2Vec, and CountVectorizer, and used Logistic Regression and Random Forest to categorize the lyrics into genres.

   - **Hybrid Classifier for Notification Classification**

     This project classifies system notifications using a hybrid approach with regular expressions, Logistic Regression, and an LLM in GroqCloud. It was further developed and deployed on a local server using FastAPI to serve predictions.

   - **Crop Leaf Disease Classification**

      I developed a CNN-based model for classifying crop leaf diseases, achieving over 90% validation accuracy. A web application was built using FastAPI and Node.js, enabling users to upload images for real-time predictions. The project demonstrates my skills in deep learning, image classification, and full-stack development.

3. **Data Analytics & Visualization**  
4. **Mini Data Science Projects**

   - [Fraud Transaction Predicting Model](https://github.com/Nipuna-Tennakoon/Portfolio-Nipuna-Tennakoon/tree/main/Mini%20Data%20Science%20Projects/Fraud%20Transaction%20Predicting%20Model) predicts the fraud transactions which is trained by random forest classifier. Exploratory data analysis in using pandas libraries and have used Matplotlib for the visualization tasks. Scikit Learning RandomForestClassifier is used to the training the model.

   - [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Nipuna-Tennakoon/Portfolio-Nipuna-Tennakoon/tree/main/Mini%20Data%20Science%20Projects/Movie%20Recommendation%20System) uses a content-based filtering method to recommend movies, utilizing cosine similarity to measure similarities between movie content.
   - [Customer Segmentation with KMeans](https://github.com/Nipuna-Tennakoon/Portfolio-Nipuna-Tennakoon/tree/main/Mini%20Data%20Science%20Projects/Customer%20Segmentation%20with%20KMeans) This notebook analyzes the mall customer dataset to cluster customers based on their details. Utilized Pandas for data handling, KMeans from Scikit-Learn for clustering, and Seaborn for visualization.
